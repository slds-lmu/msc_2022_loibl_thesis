\subsection{Model-based Trees}
\subsubsection{SLIM}
Avoid selection bias by using MOB, CTree or GUIDE to split.
Comparison of the methods in \citep{Schlosser.24.06.2019}

\subsubsection{MOB}
Score based M-Fluctuation Test \\
\textbf{Advantage}: High Power in detecting structural change points

\subsubsection{CTree}
Score based Permutation Test \\
\textbf{Advantage}: High Power in detecting smooth changes

\subsubsection{GUIDE}
Residual based categorical association test\\
\textbf{Advantage}: Scores do not have to be available\\
\textbf{Disadvantage}: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item maybe less Power than the other tests
    \item source code not available \citep{Loh.2014}
\end{itemize}
