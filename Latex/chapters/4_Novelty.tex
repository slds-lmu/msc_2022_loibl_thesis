Currently three different possible approaches:
\subsection{Unbiased SLIM Alternatives}
Avoid selection bias by using MOB, CTree or GUIDE to split.
Comparison of the methods in \citep{Schlosser.24.06.2019}

\subsubsection{MOB}
Score based M-Fluctuation Test \\
\textbf{Advantage}: High Power in detecting structural change points
\subsubsection{CTree}
Score based Permutation Test \\
\textbf{Advantage}: High Power in detecting smooth changes

\subsubsection{GUIDE}
Residual based categorical association test\\
\textbf{Advantage}: Scores do not have to be available\\
\textbf{Disadvantage}: Less Power than the other tests




\subsection{SLIM with Permutation Tests}
Idea: \citep{.4581}
Test at each split by permutation tests whether there is a significant relationship between the predictor and the response

\subsection{Stable SLIM}
Improve the stability by applying a method similar to \citep{Zhou.2018}
\textbf{Disadvantage}:
