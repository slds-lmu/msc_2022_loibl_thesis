Currently three different possible approaches:
\subsection{Unbiased SLIM Alternatives}
Avoid selection bias by using MOB or GUIDE to split. For models without scores, alternatives would have to be found with MOB. For MOB, it would first have to be proven whether the tests are valid at all under the special assumptions.

\subsection{SLIM with Permutation Tests}

\subsection{Stable SLIM}
Improve the stability by applying a method similar to \citep{Zhou.2018}
