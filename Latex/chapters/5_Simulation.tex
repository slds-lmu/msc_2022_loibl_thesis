What should be checked by the simulations?
\begin{itemize}
    \item SLIM Accuracy (Train/Test)
    \item SLIM Fidelity (Train/Test)
    \item Blackbox Accuracy (Train/Test)
    \item Interpretability (e.g. number of leaf nodes)
    \item Stability (e.g. number of occurence of unique structures of a tree (barplot) \citep{Zhou.2018}, adjusted Rand index (ARI) \citep{Schlosser.24.06.2019}
\end{itemize}


What scenarios are we interested in?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item basic scenario linear: relatively simple linear model with few predictors and interactions (can possibly be omitted)
    e.g. $$y = x_{1} + 4x_{2} + 3 x_{2}x_{3} + 5x_{2}x_{4} + 2x_{1}(I_{x5>0}) + \epsilon$$
    with predictors $x_{1},...,x_{5}$ iid $U(-1,1)$
    \item basic scenario nonlinear: simple nonlinear model with few predictors and interactions 
    \item complex scenario nonlinear:  complex nonlinear model with many predictors and interactions 
    \item sparse scenario: basic scenario + multiple noise variables (Lasso Regression)
    \item Multicollinearity: basic scenario with correlated predictors (Lasso/Ridge Regression or concept trees)
    \item skewed scenario: basic scenario + skewed distribution of the predictors
    \item outlier scenario: basic scenario + need for a robust regression
    \item selection bias scenario: Simulate probability of variable selection when the respone is independent of all variables \citep{Hothorn.2006}
\end{enumerate}
