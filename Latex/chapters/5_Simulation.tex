What should be checked by the simulations?
\begin{itemize}
    \item SLIM Accuracy (Train/Test)
    \item SLIM Fidelity (Train/Test)
    \item Blackbox Accuracy (Train/Test)
    \item Interpretability
    \item Stability
\end{itemize}


What scenarios are we interested in?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item basic scenario linear: relatively simple linear model with few predictors and interactions (can possibly be omitted)
    \item basic scenario nonlinear: simple nonlinear model with few predictors and interactions 
    \item complex scenario nonlinear:  complex nonlinear model with many predictors and interactions 
    \item sparse scenario: basic scenario + multiple noise variables (Lasso Regression)
    \item skewed scenario: basic scenario + skewed distribution of the predictors
    \item outlier scenario: basic scenario + need for a robust regression
    \item selection bias scenario: 
\end{enumerate}
