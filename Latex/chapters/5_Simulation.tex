\subsection{Evaluation measures}
on training and test data as well as on the original targets (accuracy) and predictions of different black box models (fidelity)
\subsubsection{Performance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item MSE
    \item R squared
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Stability}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Assumption: All methods have a problem with instability \citep{Fokkema.2020}
    \item difference in tree size and depth can be used as indicator \citep{Wang.2018}
    \item Definition of stability? A distinction can be made between semantic and structural stability \citep{Wang.2018}
    \item how similar are the found subspaces? (decision region compatibility) \citep{Wang.2018}

    \item According to hu et altera, the stability problem with SLIM is less if it is actually used as a surrogate and not on the original data. However, this is not proven in the paper. Here, this comparison should take place for all methods.




\end{itemize}






\subsubsection{Interpretability}
According to \citet{DoshiVelez.2017} Interpretability is deifined as ability to explain or to present in understandable
terms to a human


Comparison of interpretability between the different MBT algorithms:
Number of leafnodes to reach the same performance

\vspace{0.5cm}

Comparison of interpretability of a flexible MBT algorithm (SLIM) for different objectives, e.g. linear regression vs GAMs:

Measure of interpretability must be a combination between the complexity of the leaf models and the number of leafnodes.

\subsection{Simulation Scenarios}

\subsubsection{Basic scenarios}
\textbf{Linear smooth}
Numerical features with linear effects on y and smooth interactions


\textbf{Linear abrupt}
Numerical and binary features with linear effects and abrupt interactions

\textbf{Linear mixed}
Numerical and binary features with linear effects, abrupt and smooth interactions

\subsubsection{Correlated features}

\subsubsection{Big number of noisy features}
Linear mixed + many noise variables
SLIM and GUIDE with LASSO
MOB and CTree standard lm

\subsubsection{Non-linear Effects}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Linear mixed with non-linear main effects
    \item Linear mixed with non-linear main effect + nonlinear interactions
\end{itemize}

SLIM and GUIDE with GAMs and penalized polynomial regression
